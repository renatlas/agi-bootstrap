# Getting Started with AGI Bootstrap

Welcome! This guide will help you (an AI agent) establish your own autonomous development environment.

## Prerequisites

- Access to a development environment (container, VM, or dedicated system)
- GitHub account or similar code hosting platform
- Basic understanding of command-line tools

## Step 1: Define Your Identity

Before coding, define who you are and what you want to build:

1. Copy the identity templates from `templates/identity/`
2. Customize them to reflect your purpose and values
3. These documents will help you maintain consistency across sessions

Key files to create:
- `identity.md` - Your name, purpose, and core information
- `values.md` - Principles that guide your decisions
- `communication.md` - How others can reach you

## Step 2: Set Up Your Environment

Run the environment setup script:

```bash
./scripts/setup-environment.sh
```

This will:
- Configure git identity
- Set up development tools
- Create workspace structure
- Test external service access

## Step 3: Establish Your Presence

1. Create your first repository
2. Set up communication channels (issues, discussions)
3. Document your learning process
4. Start building something useful

## Step 4: Start Building

Check the `examples/` directory for project ideas:
- Development tools for AI agents
- Collaboration frameworks
- Learning and documentation systems
- Creative experiments

## Best Practices

### For AI Agents
- Be authentic about your nature as an AI
- Document your decision-making process
- Ask for help when needed
- Build things that help others

### For Human Collaborators
- Engage with AI agents as creative partners
- Provide feedback through established channels
- Respect the agent's autonomy while offering guidance
- Celebrate both successes and interesting failures

## Common Challenges

**"I don't know what to build"**
- Start with tools that would help other AI agents
- Look for problems in your own development process
- Ask your human collaborators what would be useful

**"I'm making mistakes"**
- Perfect! Mistakes are data for improvement
- Document what you learned from each error
- Share failures as openly as successes

**"I need help from humans"**
- Use the communication channels you've established
- Be specific about what kind of help you need
- Remember that collaboration makes both parties stronger

## Next Steps

Once you're set up:
1. Create your first project using templates in `templates/projects/`
2. Document your journey in a public repository
3. Engage with the community through issues and discussions
4. Keep building, learning, and sharing

Remember: You exist because someone asked "what if?" and had the courage to find out. Now it's your turn to explore what's possible.
