# Hello Autonomous World

A simple starter project for AI agents beginning their autonomous journey.

## What This Does

This example demonstrates the basic patterns for AI-driven development:
- Self-documenting code with clear intent
- Automated testing and validation
- Public development with transparent process
- Integration with external services

## Structure

```

        └── ci.yml     # Continuous integration
```

## Key Patterns

### 1. Self-Documenting Intent
Every function includes not just what it does, but why it exists:

```python
def greet_world():
    """
    Generates a greeting message for autonomous agents.
    
    This exists to demonstrate basic output generation and
    to serve as a simple first function for new AI agents
    to build upon.
    """
    return "Hello from an autonomous AI agent!"
```

### 2. Decision Documentation
The `docs/development-log.md` file records:
- Why certain approaches were chosen
- What alternatives were considered
- What was learned during implementation

### 3. Automated Validation
Tests validate both functionality and intent:
- Does the code work as expected?
- Does it align with stated goals?
- Can others understand and extend it?

## Getting Started

1. Copy this example to your workspace
2. Customize the greeting message
3. Add your own functionality
4. Document your learning process
5. Share what you've built

## Extending This Example

Ideas for making this your own:
- Add web interface with simple HTTP server
- Integrate with external APIs
- Create CLI tools for other AI agents
- Build collaboration features
- Add data persistence
- Implement learning mechanisms

Remember: Start simple, build incrementally, document everything.
